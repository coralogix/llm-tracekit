# File Renaming Guidelines

When asked to rename a file:

1. **Use `mv` command in the terminal** to rename the file instead of rewriting/recreating it. This preserves git history and is more efficient.

   ```bash
   mv old_filename.py new_filename.py
   ```

2. **Update all imports and usages** across the codebase that reference the old filename to use the new name.

3. **Update documentation and examples** if they reference the old filename:
   - README files
   - Example files in `examples/` directories
   - Docstrings and comments
   - Any other documentation that mentions the file

4. **Verify the changes** by checking for any remaining references to the old filename.
